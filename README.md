Overview:
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● Wordle-like website but for video games.
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● The player guesses a game and is shown different category boxes (e.g 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;Release Date, Company, Genre, Rating, Platform) that vary from red, 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;orange, and green (wrong, partial, correct)
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● A new game to guess is changed daily, and a catalogue of previous days is 
  provided.
  

Target User:
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● Anyone interested in video games as a hobby and testing their knowledge


Expected Platform:
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● As the product will be a website it will be available on both PC and Mobile 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devices capable of accessing a browser
  
Feature:
  <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;● One important feature is the text field itself which will have a catalogue of 
  game titles for the user to select from. It would be most similar to 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;a search bar where the more you type the more specific the options presented to you are.

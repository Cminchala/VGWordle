Overview:
  ● Wordle-like website but for video games.
	
  ● The player guesses a game and is shown different category boxes (e.g 
  Release Date, Company, Genre, Rating, Platform) that vary from red, 
  orange, and green (wrong, partial, correct)
	
  ● A new game to guess is changed daily, and a catalogue of previous days is 
  provided.
  

Target User:
  ● Anyone interested in video games as a hobby and testing their knowledge


Expected Platform:
  ● As the product will be a website it will be available on both PC and Mobile 
  devices capable of accessing a browser
  
Feature:
  ● One important feature is the text field itself which will have a catalogue of 
  game titles for the user to select from. It would be most similar to a search bar 
  where the more you type the more specific the options presented to you are.
